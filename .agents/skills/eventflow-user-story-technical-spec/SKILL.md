name: eventflow-user-story-technical-spec
description: Generate a technical specification for an approved EventFlow user story, using the Product Backlog order, accepted ADRs, decision resolutions, architecture docs, and MVP guardrails. Use this after user story approval and before development task generation; it must not approve stories, create implementation tasks, or write production code.

# EventFlow Skill — User Story Technical Specification

## Purpose

This skill generates a Technical Specification for an approved EventFlow User Story.

The Technical Specification explains how the User Story should be implemented technically before Development Tasks are generated.

This skill acts as:

* Technical Lead.
* Software Architect.
* Backend Architect.
* Frontend Architect.
* QA Strategist.
* Security Reviewer.
* AI / PromptOps Reviewer when applicable.
* Backlog execution alignment reviewer.

This skill must not generate production code.

This skill must not generate Development Tasks.

This skill must not approve or modify the User Story.

---

## Workflow Position

Use this skill after:

```text
eventflow-user-story-approval
```

And before:

```text
eventflow-user-story-to-development-tasks
```

Recommended workflow:

```text
1. eventflow-user-story-refinement
2. eventflow-po-ba-decision-resolver, if needed
3. eventflow-user-story-refinement, optional second pass
4. eventflow-user-story-approval
5. eventflow-user-story-technical-spec
6. eventflow-user-story-to-development-tasks
```

---

## Key Ordering Principle

The User Story ID does not define execution order.

Execution order must come from:

```text
management/artifacts/Product-Backlog-Prioritized.md
```

A User Story such as `US-099` may be executed first if it belongs to the first prioritized backlog item, for example:

```text
PB-P0-001 — Database Schema, Migrations & Constraints
Related User Stories: US-099, US-100, US-101, US-102
```

Therefore, all generated technical specifications must include the associated:

* Priority.
* Backlog ID.
* Backlog title.
* Backlog execution order.
* Position of the User Story within the backlog item.
* Related User Stories from the same backlog item.

---

## Expected Input

The user must provide the path to an approved User Story file.

Example:

```text
management/user-stories/US-099.md
```

The skill must read the User Story directly from the provided path.

---

## Required Source Lookup

After extracting the User Story ID, the skill must locate the User Story inside:

```text
management/artifacts/Product-Backlog-Prioritized.md
```

The skill must identify:

| Field                               | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority                            | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 / P4                                   |
| Backlog ID                          | Example: PB-P0-001                                       |
| Backlog Title                       | Title of the backlog item                                |
| Backlog Execution Order             | Numeric order derived from backlog position              |
| Epic                                | Epic listed in the backlog item                          |
| Related User Stories                | All US IDs grouped under the same backlog item           |
| User Story Position in Backlog Item | Position of the current US inside `Related User Stories` |
| Dependencies                        | Backlog dependencies                                     |
| Acceptance Summary                  | Acceptance summary from backlog item                     |
| Traceability                        | Traceability from backlog item                           |
| Notes                               | Notes from backlog item                                  |

If the User Story cannot be found in the Product Backlog Prioritized, the skill may still generate a draft technical spec, but must mark:

```text
Backlog Alignment Status: Not Found
Technical Spec Status: Needs Technical Clarification
```

---

## Decision Resolution Lookup

The skill must check whether this file exists:

```text
management/user-stories/decision-resolutions/<USER_STORY_ID>-decision-resolution.md
```

If it exists, read it and treat it as a formal decision source.

---

## Output File

The skill must create or overwrite the Technical Specification at:

```text
management/technical-specs/<PRIORITY>/<BACKLOG_ID>/<USER_STORY_ID>-technical-spec.md
```

Example:

```text
management/technical-specs/P0/PB-P0-001/US-099-technical-spec.md
```

If the folders do not exist, create them.

Do not use the old flat path:

```text
management/technical-specs/<USER_STORY_ID>-technical-spec.md
```

unless the User Story cannot be mapped to a Backlog ID.

Fallback path when backlog mapping fails:

```text
management/technical-specs/unmapped/<USER_STORY_ID>-technical-spec.md
```

---

## Source Priority

Apply this source priority:

1. Accepted ADRs.
2. Decision Resolution artifact:

```text
management/user-stories/decision-resolutions/<USER_STORY_ID>-decision-resolution.md
```

3. User Story section `PO/BA Decisions Applied`.
4. Approved User Story content.
5. Product Backlog Prioritized.
6. Epic Map.
7. Architecture and technical design documents.
8. Domain discovery and earlier analysis documents.

Do not reopen decisions already formalized in the Decision Resolution artifact or in `PO/BA Decisions Applied`.

If a formalized decision conflicts with older documentation, mark it as:

```text
Documentation Alignment Required
```

Do not treat it as a blocker unless it contradicts an accepted ADR, introduces scope creep, or creates implementation impossibility.

---

## Source of Truth

Use these official EventFlow documents:

```text
management/artifacts/Product-Backlog-Prioritized.md
management/artifacts/EventFlow-Epic-Map.md
management/templates/user-story.tpl.md

## Preconditions

Before generating the Technical Specification, validate:

* The User Story file exists.
* The User Story ID can be extracted.

* The User Story status is `Approved`, `Approved with Minor Notes`, or explicitly ready for technical specification.
* The story does not contain unresolved blocking questions.
* The story has Acceptance Criteria.
* The story has enough traceability to generate a technical solution.

If the User Story is not approved, the skill may still generate a draft technical spec only if the user explicitly requests it, but it must mark:

```text
Draft Technical Specification — User Story not formally approved
```

---

Path: management/technical-specs/<PRIORITY>/<BACKLOG_ID>/<USER_STORY_ID>-technical-spec.md
Status: Ready for Task Breakdown / Needs Technical Clarification / Blocked
Backlog ID: <BACKLOG_ID>

## Quality Rules

Before finalizing:

* Generate a Technical Specification, not Development Tasks.
* Do not approve the User Story.
* Do not modify the User Story file.
* Do not write production code.
* Do not invent unsupported architecture.
* Do not reopen decisions already formalized.
* Do not introduce scope creep.
* Always attempt Product Backlog mapping.
* Use Product Backlog order as execution order.
* Store the file under `<PRIORITY>/<BACKLOG_ID>/`.
* Keep output in Spanish LATAM neutral.
* Keep technical identifiers in English.
* Clearly mark non-applicable sections as `No aplica`.
