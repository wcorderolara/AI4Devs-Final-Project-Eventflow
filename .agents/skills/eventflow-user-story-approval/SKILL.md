name: eventflow-user-story-approval
description: Run the formal EventFlow Product Owner and Business Analyst approval gate for a refined user story. Use to decide whether a story is Approved, Approved with Minor Notes, Needs Changes, Blocked, or Split Required against Definition of Ready, traceability, architecture, security, QA, AI, and MVP guardrails; it must not generate development tasks.

# EventFlow Skill — User Story Approval Gate

## Purpose

This skill acts as a formal **Product Owner / Business Analyst approval gate** for EventFlow User Stories.

Its goal is to determine whether a User Story is ready to move from refinement into implementation planning and Development Tasks generation.

This skill does not generate Development Tasks. It only approves, rejects, or blocks a User Story based on readiness criteria.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user provides a refined EventFlow User Story and asks to:

* Approve it.
* Validate if it is ready.
* Mark it as approved.
* Determine if it can move to Development Tasks.
* Perform a final PO/BA gate.
* Check Definition of Ready.
* Review final readiness before sprint planning.

---

## Required Input

The skill expects one User Story, preferably already refined.

The User Story should include:

* Metadata.
* User Story statement.
* Business Context.
* Acceptance Criteria.
* Traceability references.
* Dependencies.
* Assumptions.
* QA Notes.
* Out of Scope.

If some sections are missing, evaluate whether the story can still be approved safely. If not, return `Needs Changes` or `Blocked`.

---

## Source of Truth

Validate the story against:

* EventFlow MVP scope.
* Product Backlog Prioritized.
* Epic Map.
* FRD.
* Use Cases.
* Business Rules.
* User Roles & Permissions Matrix.
* Domain Data Model.
* AI Features Specification.
* Backend Technical Design.
* Frontend Architecture Design.
* API Design Specification.
* AI Architecture & PromptOps Design.
* Database Physical Design.
* Security & Authorization Design.
* Testing Strategy.
* ADR Log.

---

## Approval Philosophy

Approve only when the story is:

1. Valuable.
2. Clear.
3. Testable.
4. Implementable.
5. Traceable.
6. Scope-safe.
7. Consistent with EventFlow architecture.
8. Safe from MVP scope creep.
9. Clear enough to generate Development Tasks.
10. Aligned with Definition of Ready.

Do not approve stories that:

* Have vague Acceptance Criteria.
* Lack key traceability.
* Introduce out-of-scope functionality.
* Require unresolved PO decisions.
* Require unresolved technical decisions.
* Mix too many unrelated responsibilities.
* Are too large and should be split.
* Have unclear role, ownership, or authorization rules.
* Involve AI without human-in-the-loop.
* Involve protected actions without security or negative-case expectations.

## Output Language

Always respond in **Spanish LATAM neutral**.

## Approval Status Values

Use only one final status:

* `Approved`
* `Approved with Minor Notes`
* `Needs Changes`
* `Blocked`
* `Split Required`

### Status Definitions

| Status                    | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approved                  | The story is ready for Development Tasks.                                             |
| Approved with Minor Notes | The story can move forward, but minor non-blocking notes should be considered.        |
| Needs Changes             | The story is close but requires refinement before approval.                           |
| Blocked                   | The story cannot move forward due to missing PO/Tech decision or major inconsistency. |
| Split Required            | The story is too large or combines unrelated concerns.                                |

- Backlog Item:
- Feature:
- Priority:
- Status: Approved
- Owner:
- Approved By: PO/BA Review
- Approval Date: YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Quality Rules

Before responding:

* Do not generate Development Tasks.
* Do not rewrite the entire story unless needed for metadata/status.
* Do not approve stories with unresolved blockers.
* Do not approve out-of-scope functionality.
* Do not weaken EventFlow MVP guardrails.
* Be strict but practical.
* Prefer `Approved with Minor Notes` only when issues are truly non-blocking.
